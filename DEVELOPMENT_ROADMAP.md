- **Testing**: Add unit tests and UI tests
- **Documentation**: Better code documentation

### **Code Quality Standards** 📝
- **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive variable/function names
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for all user flows
- **Performance**: Monitor and optimize memory usage
- **Accessibility**: Support VoiceOver and other accessibility features

## 📊 **Success Metrics & KPIs**

### **Phase 1 Metrics** 📈
- App downloads and retention
- Gift option usage rates
- User feedback and ratings
- Technical stability (crash rates)

### **Phase 2 Metrics** 🎯
- Gift purchase conversion rates
- Average order value
- User satisfaction with checkout
- Technical performance (API response times)

### **Long-term Metrics** 🚀
- Monthly active users
- Revenue per user
- User lifetime value
- Market penetration

## 🚧 **Risk Mitigation & Contingencies**

### **Technical Risks** ⚠️
- **API Dependencies**: Have fallback options for gift services
- **Payment Processing**: Ensure PCI compliance and security
- **Performance**: Monitor app performance as features grow

### **Business Risks** 💼
- **Gift Card Margins**: Understand profitability before scaling
- **User Adoption**: Validate Phase 1 before Phase 2 investment
- **Competition**: Monitor market for similar solutions

## 🤔 **Clarifying Questions for Roadmap Refinement**

### **Business Strategy** 💭
1. **Timeline**: What's your target launch date for Phase 2?
2. **Budget**: What resources are available for Phase 2 development?
3. **Team**: Will you be building this yourself or hiring developers?
4. **Market**: Who is your primary target audience?

### **Technical Decisions** ⚙️
1. **Backend**: Do you want to build a custom backend or use BaaS (Backend as a Service)?
2. **Gift Cards**: Which gift card categories are most important to your users?
3. **Payment**: Are you comfortable with Apple Pay + traditional payment methods?
4. **Analytics**: What user behavior data do you want to track?

### **Feature Priorities** 🎯
1. **Core vs. Nice-to-Have**: Which Phase 2 features are essential vs. optional?
2. **User Research**: Have you talked to potential users about their gift-buying habits?
3. **Competitive Analysis**: What existing solutions are you competing with?
4. **Monetization**: What's your preferred revenue model?

## 📅 **Recommended Next Steps**

### **Immediate (Next 2-4 weeks)** ⚡
1. **Phase 1 Polish**: Fix any remaining bugs or UX issues
2. **User Testing**: Get feedback from real users on current functionality
3. **Market Research**: Investigate gift card API options and pricing
4. **Technical Planning**: Design Phase 2 architecture

### **Short-term (1-3 months)** 📋
