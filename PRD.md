# Birthday App - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## ðŸ“‹ **Context**
Wishing someone happy birthday takes <30s and means a lot to people. Right now the most reliable source of birthdays is Facebook, but the app is so bloated and unpleasant to visit.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Statement**
It's difficult to keep track of friends over time and remember to wish them happy birthday. This is problematic because it can lead to atrophy of relationships.

## ðŸš€ **Product Vision**
The app will send a daily digest of your friends birthdays. The app would allow you to send personalized texts, e-cards, and gifts with a few button clicks.

Gift options include sending e-gift cards, scheduling flower deliveries, or sending presents (from amazon or other popular online sellers).

If successful, the app could be expanded to support anniversaries, holidays, or any other event that prompts gift giving.
